1. - Log in via API instead of UI
   - Remove all instances of "cy.wait" and wait for API responses instead

2. - I  would setup a azure pipeline to do the following
	* Pull branch from source control
	* Restore packages 
	* Run build 
	* Run lint checks
	* Run Unit tests
	* Run UI sanity tests
	* Copy/Store artifacts (reports and logs)
	* Push to main

3. I would use Neoload to do load testing. (this is the only type of performance test of done)

4. I have not yet had expose to security/pen testing.
5. I would use try{}catch{}. ALOT.
